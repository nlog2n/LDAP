Powershell usage:

Powershell - Execution of Scripts Disabled


Simply, you can bypass this policy by adding -ExecutionPolicy ByPass when running PowerShell:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File script.ps1


Or

1. open start->accessories -> windows powershell ISE, 
   right click x86 version and choose "Run as administrator".
2. get-executionpolicy
  restricted
3. set-executionpolicy unrestricted

4. .\GenericSearch.ps1  ( which is an LDAP filter tool)

5. set-executionpolicy restricted



Help:

see get-help set-executionpolicy for the possible settings, 
then set it as appropriate for your environment.

Will allow unsigned powershell scripts to run.

Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
Will not allow unsigned powershell scripts to run.

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
